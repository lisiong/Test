title: Sign up for ACE Room Familiarisation Sessions
---
<div class="blurb">
<h1>Who will benefit from this session?</h1> 
<p>If you have been timetabled to use the ACE rooms for your class, you will benefit from a short one-to-one 30-minute ACE room familiarization with us.</p>
<p>Those of you who have gone through the familiarization session in the previous trimester can choose to also take this up as refresher.<p>

<h1>Agenda:</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Introduction to the tools and software (e.g. COWs and NetSupport School software)</li>
    <li>Some tips in planning and facilitating lessons in the ACE room</li>
    <li>Basic troubleshooting and getting help</li>
 </ol>   

<p>We recommend that the familiarization takes place at least one day before your first class at the ACE room and at your convenient time slot.</p>

<p>Do let <a href="mailto:sit-colead@singaporetech.edu.sg">CoLEAD</a> know which is your preferred time slot(s) in advance so we can book the venue and plan for the session.

<p>Thank you.</p>
